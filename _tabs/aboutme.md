"Set for the defense of the Gospel." — Philippians 1:17

---

I am **AthanasiusXOR** — red team security engineer, malware developer, and confessional theologian.

I do not merely emulate threat actors; I **confront the false confidence of a fallen world**. I dwell in command lines and creeds, writing both **exploits and exegesis**, building infrastructure and doctrine with the same guiding conviction:

> I belong to the **Lord of Lords**, the **King of Kings**, and I answer to **Him first** — in every engagement, every payload, every disclosure.

I reject the myth of moral neutrality in cybersecurity. 

I do not partition ethics from engineering.  

My discipline is not my own — it is **the obedience of faith** (Romans 1:5).

I am under command — not from a corporate policy, but from the **everlasting Word** of the triune God.

---

## Who I Am

I am a **red teamer by trade**, a **disciple by regeneration**, and a **watchman by calling** (Ezekiel 33:7).  

I simulate intrusion — but I live under **submission**.  

I breach systems — but I do not **breach conscience**.

- I build hardened labs not for play, but for **principle**.  
- I execute payloads not for ego, but to **test integrity**.  
- I evade detection not to deceive, but to **reveal weakness and warn the unaware**.

My hands may write malware, but my heart is **bound to Christ**.  

My actions are not governed by corporate risk appetite, but by **divine righteousness**.

> *"We destroy arguments and every lofty opinion raised against the knowledge of God, and take every thought captive to obey Christ." — 2 Corinthians 10:5*

I live under the weight of a greater evaluation — not the SOC, but the **judgment seat of Christ** (2 Cor. 5:10).

---

## I Am Not

- I am **not** a glorified threat actor.
- I am **not** a philosophical pluralist.
- I am **not** a brand masquerading as a man of conviction.  

- I do not romanticize the adversary role — I **redeem** it.  
- I do not flirt with theological imagery — I **fear the Lord**.  
- I do not hide Christ behind jargon — I **confess Him openly**.

My operational life is subject to my **confessional allegiance**. 

There is no 1337 shell that justifies ethical apathy.  

There is no engagement worth trading **holiness** for a successful **bypass**.

---

## My Operational Trinity

Every red team operation bears witness — whether it knows it or not — to the nature of reality under God's rule.

I see the red team engagement as a form of **moral typology**, mirroring the self-revealing character of God:

- **Reconnaissance (The Father)**  
  → Intelligence before intrusion. The sovereign knowledge that precedes movement. God sees all, knows all, and initiates all.  
- **Exploitation (The Son)**  
  → Embodiment. Entry. Execution. The Word became flesh and entered hostile space. Red teaming reenacts, in shadow, the purposeful engagement of Christ.  
- **Persistence & Evasion (The Spirit)**  
  → Presence. Indwelling. Endurance in contested territory. A long witness, hidden yet powerful — as the Spirit operates unseen, so does a payload for truth.

Red teaming is not theology — but it **cannot escape theology**. Every operation assumes truth, assumes purpose, and assumes judgment. I seek to bring **these assumptions into the light**.

## What Is Nicene Security?

**Nicene Security** is my field post.  
It is the overlap of **missiology and methodology**, of **theological clarity and technical rigor**.

This is where:

- **Payloads are principled**  
- **Infrastructure is missional**  
- **Training is confessional**  
- **Contention is loving**  

Nicene Security does not aim for market appeal or social clout. It exists because **the truth must be proclaimed**, even in contested domains, even in digital shadows.

> *"Sanctify them in the truth; Your word is truth." — John 17:17*

## My Ethical Framework

The rules of engagement are not defined by the client. 

They are not shaped by ROI or detection risk.

They are subject to **the fear of the Lord** — which is the **beginning of knowledge** (Prov. 1:7).

### Therefore:

- I will not execute tradecraft that violates conscience.  
- I will not glorify compromise, even in simulation.  
- I will not separate faith from function, or ethics from engagement.

**My operating doctrine is not situational — it is Scriptural.**

And when I must choose between the success of an op and the integrity of the gospel, **I choose Christ**. Always.

---

## Core Convictions

- **Theology Is Foundational**  
    Not optional. Not metaphor. Doctrine forms the operator.

- **Truth Is Not Obfuscated**  
    Even if payloads are. We clarify what matters.

- **Adversarial Roles Require Accountability**  
    Red teaming without ethics is compromise in disguise.

- **Christ Is Lord of the Cyber Domain**  
    The call to follow Him extends to shellcode, scripts, assessments, and adversary simulations.

- **The Gospel Is the Ultimate Disclosure**  
    The truest breach was the veil torn in two — and it is *this* good news we proclaim:  
    That Christ died for our sins, was buried, and rose again according to the Scriptures.

## Why It Matters

Because deception is real — in networks and in nations, in pulpits and platforms.

Because security means nothing if it defends a lie.

Because **hell is not a vulnerability scan** — it is the just judgment of a holy God.

Because I want to **train red teamers who fear God**, **engineer systems that respect reality**, and **proclaim a gospel that saves**.
