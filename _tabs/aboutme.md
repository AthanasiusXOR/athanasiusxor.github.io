# About AthanasiusXOR

> *"Am I now seeking the approval of man, or of God? Or am I trying to please man? If I were still trying to please man, I would not be a servant of Christ."* — **Galatians 1:10**

I am **AthanasiusXOR** — Red Team Security Engineer, malware developer, and confessional theologian. 

I operate at the intersection of offensive security and historical orthodoxy. In a field often defined by moral neutrality, I lead with a conscience bound to the Word of God, ensuring that every engagement is executed with technical rigor and biblical integrity.

## The Vocation of the Red Teamer

I do not view cybersecurity as a neutral trade, but as a **vocation**. My work in breach simulation and malware development is governed by a mandate to seek truth and expose deception.

* **Red Teaming as Truth-Telling:** I simulate the adversary not to glorify the attack, but to reveal reality. A vulnerability ignored is a falsehood maintained; my role is to bring those hidden risks into the light.
* **Engineering as Stewardship:** Whether building a hardened lab or a custom C2 framework, I do so with a commitment to precision. If a thing is worth doing, it is worth doing with the exactness that reflects a Creator of order.
* **Malware with Mandate:** My development work is a controlled, ethical discipline. I write code to test the resilience of systems and the vigilance of their defenders, always under a strict moral framework.

## Nicene Security: My Operating Philosophy

**Nicene Security** is my professional field post. It represents a commitment to "Ancient Paths" in a modern domain. This framework rests on three pillars:

### 1. Ethical Absolute
I reject the "gray hat" ethos. My rules of engagement are not merely defined by a contract, but by the **fear of the Lord**. This ensures total transparency with stakeholders and a refusal to compromise conscience for the sake of a successful bypass.

### 2. Technical Rigor
Because I answer to a higher Authority, my work must meet a higher standard. I strive for excellence in shellcode, infrastructure, and reporting, knowing that we are called to work heartily, as for the Lord and not for men.

### 3. Confessional Courage
I do not partition my faith from my function. In an industry that prizes pluralism, I am a Christian first and a security engineer second. This provides a stable foundation for ethics that does not shift with corporate trends or cultural tides.

## Why "AthanasiusXOR"?

The name honors **Athanasius of Alexandria**, the 4th-century bishop who stood *Contra Mundum* (against the world) in defense of the deity of Christ. The **XOR** represents the fundamental logic gate—a reminder that in code, as in theology, there is a definitive true and false. 

I am here to defend the truth, secure the perimeter, and point toward the only One who is truly Secure.

**Contra Mundum. Code Obscurum. Christ Supreme.**
