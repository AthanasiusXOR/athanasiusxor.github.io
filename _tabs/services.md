## Penetration Testing as a Service (PTaaS)

Just as faith is continually tested and refined, so too should your security posture be tested. Our PTaaS offering provides **ongoing, subscription-based penetration testing**, ensuring that weaknesses are identified not once a year but continuously, as your environment evolves.

**Deliverables include:**
- Regular penetration testing cycles  
- Retests after remediation  
- Dashboards and prioritized findings  
- Executive and technical reporting

## Cybersecurity Analysis

We believe that clarity brings strength. Our analysis services dive deep into your infrastructure, policies, and controls to reveal blind spots and strengthen resilience.

**Services include:**
- Architecture and system reviews  
- Threat modeling and attack surface mapping  
- Business risk alignment  
- Executive-ready reporting with technical depth

## Vulnerability & Threat Assessments

Security without vigilance is negligence. We conduct thorough vulnerability and threat assessments that combine **automated scanning with human-led analysis**, prioritizing real-world risks rather than drowning you in noise.

**Our assessments provide:**
- Comprehensive vulnerability discovery  
- Risk-based prioritization  
- Threat intelligence integration  
- Roadmaps for remediation and hardening

## Red Team Operations & Offensive Consulting

Scripture calls us to be watchful and steadfast; our red team embodies that calling. We simulate **adversarial operations** to test not only your systems, but also your people, processes, and detection capabilities.

**Engagements include:**
- Full-scope red team exercises  
- Purple team collaborations with defenders  
- Custom adversary emulation plans  
- Offensive training and consulting for in-house teams

## Our Philosophy

Security is stewardship. We do not deliver reports for the sake of compliance alone. We provide **actionable, in-depth analysis** so that your organization can be transformedâ€”becoming more secure, more resilient, and better equipped to face adversaries.

At Nicene Security, assessments are not checkboxes. They are opportunities to **stand firm, be strong, and guard what has been entrusted**.
