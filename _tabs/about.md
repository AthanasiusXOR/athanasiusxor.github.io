# "Set for the defense of the Gospel" - Phillipians 1:17

---

I'm **AthanasiusXOR** — red team operator, malware developer, and theological dissident. I work at the intersection of **offensive security** and **historic orthodoxy**.

My name is a declaration of intent: I stand in the spirit of *Athanasius contra mundum* — *“Athanasius against the world.”* Just as he defended the divinity of Christ when orthodoxy was under siege, I defend secure systems and ethically aligned-principles of red team operations in an industry too often driven by hype and compromise.

I’m not here to build flashy payloads — I’m here to build **conviction-shaped infrastructure**.

## My Operational Trinity

- **Reconnaissance (The Father)** — the source of understanding  
- **Exploitation (The Son)** — the incarnate execution of strategy  
- **Persistence & Evasion (The Spirit)** — the invisible force that remains  

> *What you believe about truth shapes how you write code, conduct intrusions, and handle access.*

## About Nicene Security

**Nicene Security** is my home base — where I write, build, and reflect on the overlaps between red team operations and confessional theology.

### Purpose

- Build tools and payloads that are evasive and field-tested  
- Train operators with both technical depth and ethical roots  
- Merge ancient wisdom with modern cyber warfare

### Core Values

- **Orthodoxy Over Obfuscation** — Clarity is not weakness  
- **Stealth With Substance** — We don’t just bypass; we build with purpose  
- **Faithful Intrusion** — We test systems to strengthen them, not glorify ourselves
