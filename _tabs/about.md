# "Set for the defense of the Gospel." — Philippians 1:17

---

I’m **AthanasiusXOR** — a red team security engineer, malware developer, and confessional theologian.  
I operate at the front lines of **digital warfare** and **doctrinal fidelity**, refusing to compartmentalize faith and function, creed and command line.

My name is not branding — it’s **banner** and **battle cry**:  
In the spirit of *Athanasius contra mundum* — *“Athanasius against the world”* — I labor against falsehood wherever it hides, whether in **payloads or pulpits**, **networks or narratives**.

This work is more than technical.  
- It is missional.  
- It is theological.  
- It is **obedience**.

> *"For though we walk in the flesh, we are not waging war according to the flesh... but we destroy arguments and every lofty opinion raised against the knowledge of God." — 2 Corinthians 10:3–5*

## Who I Am

I am a red teamer who builds hardened infrastructure — not for vanity, but for the **sake of discipline**.  
I am a theologian who writes for clarity — not for applause, but for the **defense of the gospel**.

- I don’t glorify the adversary role.  
- I don’t weaponize theology for aesthetic.  
- I don’t hide the name of Christ behind jargon.

I am here to test systems — and confront idols.  
I am here to write code — and proclaim the gospel.  
I am here to make war — and to make disciples.

## My Operational Trinity

I view red teaming through a theological lens:

- **Reconnaissance (The Father)** — source, origin, intelligence  
- **Exploitation (The Son)** — incarnation, execution, embodiment  
- **Persistence & Evasion (The Spirit)** — presence, indwelling, power  

> *What you believe about truth shapes how you code, how you breach, and how you behave.*

## What Is Nicene Security?

**Nicene Security** is my field station — a platform for theological and tactical integrity.  
It is a fusion of my two callings: the protection of infrastructure and the **proclamation of truth**.

It is not playful in its convictions.  
It does not flirt with compromise.  
It exists to:

- Build tools and write payloads that are **evasive**, **resilient**, and **tested**  
- Train operators with **technical skill** and **moral gravity**  
- Merge **ancient Christian doctrine** with the demands of **modern cyber warfare**

---

## Core Values

- **Orthodoxy Over Obfuscation** — We don’t hide behind complexity. We clarify it.  
- **Stealth With Substance** — We bypass, yes — but not aimlessly.  
- **Faithful Intrusion** — We break systems to build trust, not glory.  
- **Gospel-First** — No payload is more powerful than the truth that Christ died, was buried, and rose again.
