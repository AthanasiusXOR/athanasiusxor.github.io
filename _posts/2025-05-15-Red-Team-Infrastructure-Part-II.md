## I. Introduction: From Blueprint to Build

This is **Part II** of our Azure Infrastructure series. If **[Part I](https://nicenesecurity.com/posts/Red-Team-Infrastructure-Part-I/)** laid the theological and tactical groundwork, **Part II** is where we bring it to life. As a reminder, below is a rudimentary outline of the network that we will deploy with Terraform.

We move now from **philosophy to execution** ‚Äî walking step-by-step through the files and scripts that build FAST infrastructure from scratch. Red teamers don‚Äôt just *know* how things work. We build them. We break them. And we build again.

> *"By wisdom a house is built, and by understanding it is established." ‚Äî Proverbs 24:3*

## II. Terraform Files Breakdown

### üìÑ `main.tf`

Defines core providers and virtual machines to be deployed. This file controls **what** Azure spins up.

**Key Elements:**
- Resource declarations for Kali, Windows, GoPhish, etc.
- VM size, location, disk image
- Depends on variables defined in `variables.tf`

**What You Must Edit:**
- Ensure public key paths, VM names, and images align with your operation
- Add/modify `depends_on` logic if customizing interdependent resources

> [Click the link](https://github.com/AthanasiusXOR/athanasiusxor.github.io/blob/main/scripts/terraform/azure/main.tf) below to unveil what was hidden-for as with Scripture, so with strategy, so with strategy: the form and function are revealed not in abstraction, but in faithful exposition.

---

### üìÑ `network.tf`

Defines your virtual network, subnet ranges, and public IPs.

**Key Elements:**
- VNet and Subnet CIDRs
- NSG (Network Security Group) rules
- Public/Private IP allocations

**What You Must Edit:**
- Validate address ranges (e.g., `10.0.1.0/24`) do not conflict with client environments
- Review and tighten NSG rules

---

### üìÑ `variables.tf`

Declares all configurable inputs ‚Äî passwords, SSH keys, and resource group names.

```
hcl
variable "resource_group_name" {
  description = "Name of the Azure resource group"
  type        = string
  default     = "King_of_Kings"
}

variable "windows_admin_password" {
  description = "Password for Windows RDP"
  type        = string
  sensitive   = true
  default     = "Jesus_Is_Lord"
}

variable "ssh_public_keys" {
  description = "List of public SSH keys"
  type        = list(string)
  default     = ["./Athanasius.pub"]
}
```


## What You Must Edit (from `variables.tf`)

- **Operation-specific naming** in `resource_group_name`
- A **strong Windows password** in `windows_admin_password`
- Add all relevant **`.pub` keys from operators** to `ssh_public_keys`

## III. Scripted Provisioning: Bash Automation

These `.sh` scripts run on first boot to configure VMs into fully operational red team platforms.

---

### üîß `kalisetup.sh`

Used for **Kali0, Kali1, and Kali2**. This script:

- Installs 40+ offensive tools (Metasploit, C2 profiles, Impacket, etc.)
- Configures XRDP for GUI access
- Sets RDP password for `azureuser`
- Mounts Azure SMB file shares
- Installs reflective loaders, Malleable C2 profiles, and custom Cobalt Strike tools

**What You Must Edit:**

- Replace `INSERT PASSWORD` for `azureuser`
- Replace **SMB credentials** (`username`, `password`)
- Confirm **file share mount path** if changed

---

### üîß `teamserver.sh`

Used for the **TeamServer VM**. This script:

- Updates the system and installs key red team tools
- Mounts Azure SMB file shares (same credentials as above)
- Copies and extracts `cobaltstrike-dist-linux.tgz` from the mounted share
- Preps server for C2 operation

**What You Must Edit:**

- SMB credentials
- Confirm `cobaltstrike-dist-linux.tgz` exists in `/mnt/infrastructure-setup/`

> [Click here](https://github.com/AthanasiusXOR/NiceneSecurity/tree/main/Scripts/Bash) to uncover the work done in silence ‚Äî for as the Word became flesh to dwell among us, so these bash scripts embody intention in action, revealing not just what we build, but how we labor in truth.

---

## IV. Deployment Workflow

Once your `.tf` files and bash scripts are configured, follow this deployment process:

### Authenticate to Azure

```
az login  
az account set --subscription "<Your Subscription ID>"
```

![AZ Login](assets/img/Azure-Infrastructure/AZ-Login.jpg)

![AZ Login II](assets/img/Azure-Infrastructure/AZ-Login-II.jpg)

### Deploy Infrastructure

```
terraform init  
terraform plan -out=tfplan  
terraform apply tfplan
```

Wait for all VMs to spin up ‚Äî initial provisioning may take 5‚Äì10 minutes.  
Confirm Azure Front Door and DNS manually (see next section).

---

## V. Azure Front Door & DNS Configuration

> ‚ÄúHe will be the sure foundation for your times, a rich store of salvation and wisdom and knowledge.‚Äù ‚Äî Isaiah 33:6

The Front Door of any fortress matters. This section will cover:

- Custom domain setup (e.g., Namecheap)
- TLS/SSL chaining
- Routing paths to redirectors
- WAF configuration for evasion-friendly passthrough

üìå *Coming soon ‚Äî this section will be updated with screenshots, scripts, and real deployment guidance from live operations.*

---

## VI. Operational Checklist

- ‚úÖ VMs deployed successfully?  
- ‚úÖ Bash scripts executed fully?  
- ‚úÖ CobaltStrike extracted and functional?  
- ‚úÖ Redirectors live?  
- ‚úÖ Azure Front Door configured and pointed to domain?

### Tear Down When Complete

```
terraform destroy -auto-approve
```

> ‚ÄúEvery house is built by someone, but the builder of all things is God.‚Äù ‚Äî Hebrews 3:4
