> *To all those who labor in the shadows of the digital domain, testing the gates and probing the walls, seeking what is hidden and exposing what is false — grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.*

## I. A Greeting in Truth and Warfare

I am **AthanasiusXOR** — [Red Team Security Engineer and Theologian](/about), walking between two worlds. I write code and creeds. I build payloads and confessions. And I believe the gospel of Jesus Christ is not only worth proclaiming, but worth structuring a life — and a lab — around.

I do not separate my craft from my calling. I believe that doctrine defines the operator as much as discipline. That a red teamer can reflect the integrity of a missionary, and that the Word of God should not be silent in the realm of intrusion, evasion, or automation.

## II. The Purpose of This Work

This site — **Nicene Security** — exists for a singular aim: to stand *contra mundum*, “against the world,” both in spirit and in signal.

It is a digital outpost where:

- **Theology is not optional** but foundational  
- **Red team work is not directionless** but discipled  
- **Payloads are not ornamental** but principled  
- **Infrastructure is not neutral** but missional  

Here, you will find:

- Reports from the field: [Azure Terraform Infrastructure (Part I)](#), [DLL Sideloading and Hijacking (Part I)](#), [Tool Modification for EDR Evasion (Part I)](#)  
- Dispatches on doctrine: essays defending orthodoxy in the digital age (coming soon)  
- Reflections from the breach: how intrusion trains discernment and how discipline tempers power  

This site is playful in tone — but never in conviction. My theology is not a metaphor. It is a **foundation**.

## III. Against False Prophets, in All Forms

Deception does not only arise from compromised systems — it flows from compromised souls. From shallow preaching. From easy repentance. From unchallenged idols in both code and community.

We live in a time when:

- **False trust** is placed in platforms  
- **False teachers** are welcomed for their charisma  
- **False assumptions** undergird entire networks of power  

But the gospel is not code to be rewritten.  
Truth is not a variable to be toggled.  
And security is not complete if it protects a lie.

> *"Unless the LORD watches over the city, the watchman stays awake in vain." — Psalm 127:1*

## IV. The Ministry of Intrusion

To test a system is to love it enough to uncover its flaws.  
To intrude with integrity is to image the God who exposes sin not to shame, but to save.  
To evade detection is not always subversive — sometimes it’s strategic, to reach deep places with truth.

Let the red teamer who believes never forget:

- To **test** is to love.  
- To **intrude** is to reveal.  
- To **evade** is to uncover.  
- To **report** is to warn.  
- To **harden** is to serve.  

And when done with conviction, even the adversary role becomes an act of **faithful confrontation** — exposing not for shame but for strengthening.

> *"Have nothing to do with the fruitless deeds of darkness, but rather expose them." — Ephesians 5:11*

## V. The Gospel We Defend

This mission is not neutral. Our warfare is not abstract. We contend not merely for operational truth, but for **the truth** — that God has spoken, that Christ has come, and that eternal life is found in Him alone.

> *“For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received: that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the Scriptures, that He was buried, that He was raised on the third day...” — 1 Corinthians 15:3–4*

The gospel is this:

- **God** is holy, righteous, and just.  
- **Man** is fallen, sinful, and lost.  
- **Christ** came in the flesh, lived without sin, died in our place, and rose again.  
- **Salvation** is by grace alone, through faith alone, in Christ alone — not of works, nor of will, but by the mercy of God.  

This is the doctrine we defend behind the digital ramparts.  
This is the news we proclaim — not merely in pulpits, but in payloads, posts, and every contested space.

## VI. A Preview of What Is to Come

In the coming weeks, expect to see multi-part series on:

- [Azure Terraform Infrastructure (Part I): Layout & Philosophy](#)  
- [DLL Sideloading and Hijacking (Part I): Fundamentals and Use Cases](#)  
- [Tool Modification for EDR Evasion (Part I): Why and How to Modify Your Tools](#)  
- [False Teaching in Cybersecurity Culture (Part I)](#): where marketing undermines security, and ethics are sacrificed for hype  
- A theological series titled *Intrusion and Incarnation*: how red teaming mirrors the incarnational logic of gospel truth

## VII. A Benediction and Charge

To you who read, whether hacker, theologian, soldier, or scribe:

Be discerning.  
Be dangerous to darkness.  
Be disciplined in both doctrine and defense.  

Test what is trusted — in systems, in sermons, in your own assumptions.  
Proclaim the truth — not in slogans, but in scripts and in silence, in code and in creed.

> *"Contend for the faith that was once for all delivered to the saints." — Jude 3*

**Contra Mundum. Code Obscurum.**
