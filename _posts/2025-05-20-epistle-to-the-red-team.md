> *To all those who labor in the shadows of the digital domain, testing the gates and probing the walls, seeking what is hidden and exposing what is false — grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.*

## I. A Greeting in Truth and Warfare

I, **AthanasiusXOR**, a servant of Christ and a student of the breach, write to you from the front lines of a dual battlefield — that of **doctrine** and of **digital defense**.

I write not with authority of men, nor of vendors, nor of certification, but with the conviction born of Scripture, sharpened by study, and tested by intrusion. For the age is deceitful, and its tools are cunning. Many false prophets have gone out into the world — both in pulpits and in payloads.

> *“Test all things; hold fast what is good.” — 1 Thessalonians 5:21*

## II. The Purpose of This Work

This site — **Nicene Security** — exists for a singular aim: to stand *contra mundum*, “against the world,” both in spirit and in signal.

It is a digital outpost where:

- **Theology is not optional** but foundational  
- **Red team work is not directionless** but discipled  
- **Payloads are not ornamental** but principled  
- **Infrastructure is not neutral** but missional  

Here, you will find:

- Reports from the field: [Azure Terraform Infrastructure (Part I)](/posts/azure-terraform-part-i), [DLL Sideloading and Hijacking (Part I)](/posts/dll-hijacking-part-i), [Tool Modification for EDR Evasion (Part I)](/posts/tool-mod-edr-part-i)  
- Dispatches on doctrine: essays defending orthodoxy in the digital age (coming soon)  
- Reflections from the breach: how intrusion trains discernment and how discipline tempers power  

These writings are meant to equip red teamers who wish to remain **confessionally grounded**, and believers who wish to understand **the spiritual weight of cyber warfare**.

## III. Against False Prophets, in All Forms

Let us not think that deception comes only from systems. It comes also from **ideas** — from shallow doctrines, from compromised gospel witness, from technological triumphalism masquerading as truth.

We live in a time when:

- **False trust** is placed in platforms  
- **False teachers** are welcomed for their charisma  
- **False assumptions** undergird entire networks of power  

But the gospel is not code to be rewritten.  
Truth is not a variable to be toggled.  
And security is not complete if it protects a lie.

> *“Unless the LORD watches over the city, the watchman stays awake in vain.” — Psalm 127:1*

---

## IV. The Ministry of Intrusion

To test a system is to love it enough to uncover its flaws.  
To intrude with integrity is to image the God who exposes sin not to shame, but to save.  
To evade detection is not always subversive — sometimes it’s strategic, to reach deep places with truth.

Let the red teamer who believes never forget:

- To **test** is to love.  
- To **intrude** is to reveal.  
- To **evade** is to uncover.  
- To **report** is to warn.  
- To **harden** is to serve.  

And when done with conviction, even the adversary role becomes an act of **faithful confrontation** — exposing not for shame but for strengthening.

> *“Have nothing to do with the fruitless deeds of darkness, but rather expose them.” — Ephesians 5:11*

## V. A Preview of What Is to Come

In the coming weeks, expect to see multi-part series on:

- [Azure Terraform Infrastructure (Part I): Layout & Philosophy](/posts/azure-terraform-part-i)  
- [DLL Sideloading and Hijacking (Part I): Fundamentals and Use Cases](/posts/dll-hijacking-part-i)  
- [Tool Modification for EDR Evasion (Part I): Why and How to Modify Your Tools](/posts/tool-mod-edr-part-i)  
- [False Teaching in Cybersecurity Culture (Part I)](/posts/false-teaching-tech-part-i): where marketing undermines security, and ethics are sacrificed for hype  
- A theological series titled *Intrusion and Incarnation*: how red teaming mirrors the incarnational logic of gospel truth

## VI. A Benediction and Charge

To you who read, whether hacker, theologian, soldier, or scribe:

Be discerning.  
Be dangerous to darkness.  
Be disciplined in both doctrine and defense.  

Test what is trusted — in systems, in sermons, in your own assumptions.  
Proclaim the truth — not in slogans, but in scripts and in silence, in code and in creed.

> *“Contend for the faith that was once for all delivered to the saints.” — Jude 3*

**Written at the gate of the city,**  
**by the hand of AthanasiusXOR,**  
**a watchman wired for war.**
